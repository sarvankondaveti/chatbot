        "\n",
        "This assignment explores how large language models (LLMs) can perform complex tasks that previously required coding. Instead of manually writing code, we will interact with Google's Gemini (Click on the Gemini icon on the top right corner) in Google Colab to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and analyze stock price data.\n",
        "- Engineer relevant features for prediction.\n",
        "- Build and evaluate models such as regression and random forest.\n",
        "- Discuss potential trading strategies based on predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: While this notebook contains example code, students are encouraged to use LLMs to generate code snippets and explanations, managing interactions within the LLM's context window.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task Breakdown\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Data Exploration\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Load historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-01-01 using Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "- **Key Considerations**: Ensure the model retains context while summarizing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Feature Engineering\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Generate meaningful features such as moving averages, technical indicators, and volatility measures.\n",
        "- **Managing Context**: If the LLM forgets prior outputs, remind it by reintroducing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Model Building\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Train a model (regression for price prediction, random forest for trend classification).\n",
        "- **Split Ratio Consideration**: Explain the importance of train-test split (e.g., 70/30) and verify the LLM respects it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Model Evaluation & Prediction\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Use the trained model to predict stock prices for 2023-2024.\n",
        "- **Analyze Performance**: Interpret accuracy, R² scores, and classification reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Strategy Discussion\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Based on model performance, discuss possible trading strategies.\n",
        "- **Critical Thinking**: Evaluate whether the model is truly useful for financial decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the assignment, keep in mind that LLMs have a limited context window. If necessary, break down tasks into smaller chunks and reintroduce critical information.\n",

        "Through this assignment, we have explored how LLMs can assist in complex machine learning tasks without requiring extensive coding knowledge. Key takeaways:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Context Management**: LLMs have limited memory, so breaking tasks into smaller steps and reinforcing context is crucial.\n",
        "- **Feature Engineering with LLMs**: The model can suggest features but needs guidance on financial relevance.\n",
        "- **Modeling with LLMs**: LLMs can write and refine code, but human judgment is necessary to validate results.\n",
        "- **Real-world Limitations**: Stock price prediction remains challenging; models should be used critically and not solely relied upon for trading decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next Steps:\n",
        "- Experiment with different LLMs and compare outputs.\n",
        "- Try refining feature engineering techniques.\n",
        "- Test alternative modeling approaches, such as deep learning or ensemble methods.\n",

        "# The model trained on the 2020-2023 data showed a decent accuracy of 71.82% on its test set.\n",
        "# However, when applied to the new data from 2023-2024, the performance dropped to 60.85%.\n",
        "# The confusion matrix and classification report for the 2023-2024 period highlight a significant issue:\n",
        "# The model is very good at predicting when the price will *not* increase (class 0), with high precision and recall.\n",
        "# But it is very poor at predicting when the price *will* increase (class 1), with very low recall (0.22).\n",
        "# This means that out of all the days the price actually increased, the model only correctly identified 22% of them.\n",
        "# This suggests the model struggles to capture the patterns associated with upward price movements in the new time period.\n",
        "# The market conditions and factors influencing AAPL's price might have changed between the training and prediction periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Trading Strategies Discussion:\n",
        "# Given the model's performance, particularly its weakness in predicting price increases, building a profitable trading strategy is challenging and risky.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Conservative Strategy:\n",
        "# - Action: Only buy when the model predicts an increase (Class 1).\n",
        "# - Assessment: This is highly risky because the model's recall for Class 1 is very low. You would miss most of the upward movements and potentially make trades on false positives (predicting an increase when there isn't one), although the precision for Class 1 is 1.00 in the 2023-2024 period's report, which seems contradictory to the low recall. Looking at the confusion matrix [[105,   0], [ 83,  24]], it predicted 0 increases correctly (out of 105 actual non-increases) and 24 increases correctly (out of 107 actual increases). The precision for class 1 is calculated as True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) = 24 / (24 + 0) = 1.00. The recall for class 1 is True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) = 24 / (24 + 83) = 24 / 107 = 0.22. So the precision for class 1 is indeed 1.00 on the 2023-2024 test set, meaning when it *does* predict an increase, it's always correct in this specific test set. However, it only *predicted* an increase 24 times out of 212 trading days. This makes the strategy of *only* buying when it predicts an increase very infrequent and potentially not capturing the majority of trading opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Contrarian Strategy:\n",
        "# - Action: Sell short or avoid buying when the model predicts no increase (Class 0).\n",
        "# - Assessment: The model has high recall for Class 0 (1.00 in the 2023-2024 report), meaning it's good at identifying most days when the price won't increase. The precision for Class 0 is 0.56, meaning 56% of the times it predicts no increase, it's correct. This strategy might be slightly less risky in terms of avoiding losses, but it wouldn't necessarily generate significant profits as it's based on avoiding movement, not capitalizing on it. Shorting based on a 56% precision is still quite risky.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Hybrid Strategy:\n",
        "# - Assessment: Combining strategies requires more nuanced interpretation and risk management, which is challenging with a model that has such uneven performance across classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Overall Conclusion:\n",
        "# The model, in its current form, is not reliable enough to be used as the sole basis for trading decisions, especially for predicting upward movements. The significant drop in performance on new data indicates a potential lack of generalization or sensitivity to changing market dynamics. Any trading strategy built upon this model would need very strong risk management and likely incorporate other indicators or analysis methods. Further feature engineering, exploring different models, or retraining the model on more recent data might be necessary to improve its predictive power for price increases."
